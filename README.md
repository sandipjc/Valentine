Valentine Link Generator

Create a personalized Valentine surprise for someone special.
This project lets you enter a name, generate a shareable link, and send it to your loved one. When they open it, they’ll see their name, play a fun “catch the No” game, and unlock a romantic message.

✨ Features
📝 Name Personalization – Enter a name and make the page feel custom-made

🔗 Shareable Link Generator – Creates a URL like: ?name=person-name

📲 Native Share Button – Share directly to WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, etc.

🏃 Playful “No” Button – Runs away when you try to click it

📱 Mobile-First / Instagram Story Layout – Looks great on phones

💡 Slug URLs – Converts names into clean links (Person Name → person-name)

🌍 Public & Free Hosting – Works perfectly on GitHub Pages
